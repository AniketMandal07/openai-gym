### Code Generation Model 

Developed an end-to-end code generation system that converts natural language descriptions into source code using Python and NLP techniques. Leveraged Hugging Face Datasets, PyTorch, and the Transformers library to preprocess data, fine-tune transformer-based models, and perform inference. Implemented the complete pipeline from data loading and training to evaluation and code generation.
